Instructor: Dr. McCann

Assignment: Program #2 - External Multi-Way Merge Sort
Due Date: Oct 6th, 2022, at the beginning of class

Author: Zirui Huang

Description:
    This script is to implement the external sort-merge algorithm to sort CSV files on the attribute selected
by the user, and to write out the sorted file. The user needs to provide the following arguments:

    1. the complete pathname of the CSV file whose lines are being sorted
    2. The # of the field on which the file is to be sorted (where the first field is field 1)
    3. R, the Pass 0 run-length (# of records to be sorted per group)
    4. W, the "way" for Passes 1 - n (maximum initial # of runs being merged at a time)

    The algorithm runs as follows:
        For Pass 0:
            The script reads R lines from the provided CSV file at a time. Sorting these R lines using the provided
        field, and write out the sorted lines to file "run0-[r].csv". Until the records in the CSV file are exhausted.

        For Pass 1 - n:
            The script merge-sorts every W run files from the last pass, and write out the sorted lines to file
        "run[p]-[r].csv"ã€‚Until all run files from the last pass are exhausted.
            Eventually, there is only one run file. Adding headers to this file, the script writes out the sorted
        CSV file.

Operational requirements: Python 3.8.10
